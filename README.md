## Technology Used
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

Rust Is chosen due to its robustness and speed, also due to its I/O and Networking capabilities
this makes NTGET perfect for servers due to its stability!

The NTGET Installer uses C for a very specific funtion as I hate rusts WINAPI implementaion. so i went through the hastle of cross compiling.
